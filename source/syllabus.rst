.. note::
  * Gradiance quizzes

    * Will be released every Wednesday at 9.00 AM EST
    * Due next Tuesday at 11.59 PM EST
    * Gradiance 0 will not be evaluated (warm up)
    * Gradiance 6 will be released on March 11 but will be due on March 24 due to Spring Recess

  * All assignments are electronically due on Fridays by 12.59 PM EST through UBLearns.
  * Hard copies of assignment reports will be due in-class on Fridays before the end of the class.

Assignments (Tentative Schedule)
---------------------------------
  * Programming Assignment 1 - This assignment will focus on building linear models for supervised learning. This will include implementing a linear regression model for regression, and three classification models, viz., logistic regression, perceptron, and support vector machine (SVM).
  * Programming Assignment 2 - In this assignment, your task is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron the neural network and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits. You will also use the same network to analyze a more challenging hand-drawn images dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library.
  * Programming Assignment 3 - This programming assignment has two parts. In the first part, you will implement a Naive Bayes Classifier and test it on a publicly available data set. In the second part, you will manipulate the data characteristics to understand how classifiers get impacted by the underlying bias in the training data. 

Course Texts
---------------
* Carl Rasmussen and Christopher Williams, `Gaussian Process for Machine Learning <http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/>`_, MIT Press, 2006.
* [PONotes] Peter Orbanz, :download:`Lecture Notes on Bayesian Nonparametrics <porbanz_BNP_draft.pdf>`, *unpublished*, 2014.

Grading
---------
* Homeworks (6) -- 60%
* Final Project  -- 40%
* Final grade cut-offs (*TBA*)

Exams
---------------
* This course has no exams 

Expectations
-------------
* Students are expected to act in a professional manner. A student’s grade may be reduced due to unprofessional or disruptive behavior. Examples include coming to class late, texting (or otherwise using your cell phone) during class, your cell phone ringing during class and/or exams, etc.
* Homeworks will be graded and returned to students.
* :red:`Late submission of homeworks will receive a grade of zero.`
* Students are encouraged to discuss homeworks and share ideas, but each student must independently write and submit their own solution.

Accessibility Services and Special Needs
-----------------------------------------
If you have a disability and may require some type of instructional and/or examination accommodation, please inform me early in the semester so that we can coordinate the accommodations you may need. If you have not already done so, please contact the Office of Accessibility Services (formerly the Office of Disability Services) University at Buffalo, 25 Capen Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260-1632; email: stu-accessibility@buffalo.edu Phone: 716-645-2608 (voice); 716-645-2616 (TTY); Fax: 716-645-3116; and on the web at http://www.buffalo.edu/accessibility/. All information and documentation is confidential. The University at Buffalo and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are committed to ensuring equal opportunity for persons with special needs to participate in and benefit from all of its programs, services and activities.

Academic Integrity
-------------------
This course will operate with a zero-tolerance policy regarding cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty. Any act of academic dishonesty will subject the student to penalty, including the high probability of failure of the course (i.e., assignment of a grade of “F”). It is expected that you will behave in an honorable and respectful way as you learn and share ideas. Therefore, recycled papers, work submitted to other courses, and major assistance in preparation of assignments without identifying and acknowledging such assistance are not acceptable. All work for this course must be original for this course. Additionally, you are not allowed to post course homeworks, exams, solutions, etc., on a public forum. Please be familiar with the University and the School policies regarding plagiarism. Read the Academic Integrity Policy and Procedure for more information: http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.shtml. Visit the Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs web page for the latest information at http://vpue.buffalo.edu/policies/

.. highlights:: 

   **Machine Learning Honor Code**
  
   Against the ML honor code to:

   1. Submit someone else’s work, including from the internet, as one’s own for any submission
   2. Misuse Piazza forum

   You are allowed to:

   1. Have discussions about homeworks. Every student should submit own homework with names of students in the discussion group explicitly mentioned.
   2. Collaborate in a group of 3 for the final project. One submission is required for each group.

.. warning:: 
   * Violation of ML honor code and departmental policy will result in an automatic F for the concerned submission
   * Two violations ⇒ fail grade in the course
